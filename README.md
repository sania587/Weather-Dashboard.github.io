### 4. Prerequisites <br>
To run the project locally, ensure you have: <br>
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). <br>
- Internet access to fetch data from APIs. <br>

### Instructions to Run Locally <br>
#### 4.1. Clone or Download the Project: <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-dashboard.git
```
Or simply download the files as a ZIP and extract them. <br>

#### 4.2. Set up API Keys: <br>
The project uses OpenWeatherMap API and Google Generative AI. Replace the placeholder keys with your actual API keys. <br>
In **Dashboard.js** and **Table.js**, update the following lines: <br>
```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY';
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_KEY';
```

#### 4.3. Run the Project: <br>
Open either **Dashboard.html** or **Table.html** in a web browser. <br>
You can use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode or a simple HTTP server like Python: <br>
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

### 5. Usage <br>

#### 5.1. Dashboard Page: <br>
1. Open **Dashboard.html** in the browser. <br>
2. Enter a city name in the search box. <br>
3. Toggle between °C or °F for temperature units. <br>
4. Click **Get Weather** to view the current weather and a 5-day forecast in chart form. <br>

#### 5.2. Table Page: <br>
1. Open **Table.html** in the browser. <br>
2. Enter a city name in the search box and select the temperature unit. <br>
3. Click **Get Weather** to view the forecast in a table. <br>
4. Use the **sorting** and **filtering** buttons to manipulate the table. <br>
5. Interact with the **Chatbot Assistant** by clicking the chatbot icon and typing weather-related questions (e.g., "What is the current weather in London?"). <br>

#### 5.3. External Dependencies <br>
- **Chart.js**: Used for rendering charts (loaded via CDN). <br>
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetches weather data. <br>
- **Google Generative AI**: Powers the chatbot for general and weather-related queries. <br>

#### 5.4. Troubleshooting <br>
- **City Not Found**: Ensure the city name is spelled correctly or verify the API key. <br>
- **API Limits**: The free version of OpenWeatherMap has request limits. If you reach the limit, consider upgrading to a higher plan. <br>
- **Console Errors**: Use the browser's developer console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) for error logs. <br>
